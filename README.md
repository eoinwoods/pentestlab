## Local PentestLab Management Script (Docker based)

Made for Kali linux, but should work fine with pretty much any linux distro.

### Get started 

Clone repo and use the pentestlab.sh script as described below  
```
git clone https://github.com/eystsen/pentestlab.git
cd pentestlab

# If you have not installed docker on your x64 Kali system you can run this script (tested as of Feb 2018)
# Note: I always add a regular user and login with it before actually using kali, so sudo is added in all scripts
./install_docker_kali_x64.sh

# Then run
./pentestlab.sh start bwapp

# and it will let you know that bwapp is now running on localhost at http://bwapp
# run
./pentestlab.sh list 
# for a complete list of available projects
# and just
./pentestlabs.sh 
# for help
```
